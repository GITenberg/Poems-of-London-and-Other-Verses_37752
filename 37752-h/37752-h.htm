LONDON DAWN<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Dawn over London; all the pearly light<BR>
Trembles and quivers over street and park,<BR>
The houses are a strange, unearthly white;<BR>
Pavement and roof grow slowly, palely bright;<BR>
There is no shadow, neither light nor dark<BR>
But everything is steeped in glimmering dawn.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, purity of dawn; oh, milk-and-pearl<BR>
Translucent splendour, spreading far and wide,<BR>
As on a yellow beach the small waves curl<BR>
&mdash;Almost as noiselessly as buds unfurl&mdash;<BR>
On windless mornings with the rising tide,<BR>
So flows the dawn o'er London, all asleep.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Indeed, I think that heaven is a sea,<BR>
And London is a city of old rhymes<BR>
Sunk fathoms deep in its transparency,<BR>
That folk of living lands may dream they see<BR>
And muse on, and have thoughts about our times,<BR>
How we were great and splendid, and now gone.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For never light the common earth has born,<BR>
This crystalline pale wonder that so falls<BR>
On streets and squares the daily toil has worn,<BR>
On blind-eyed houses, holding lives forlorn,<BR>
For the grey roads and wide, blank, grey-brick walls<BR>
Shine with a glory that is new and strange.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And not more wonderful, nor otherwise<BR>
Shall dawn come up upon the dewy hills,<BR>
Nor in the mountains, where the rivers rise<BR>
That water Eden; and no lovelier lies<BR>
The dawn on Paradise, than this that fills<BR>
The space 'twixt house and house with tremulous light.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yet, on the pavement, huddled fast asleep,<BR>
A thing of dusty, ragged misery,<BR>
Grotesque in wretchedness, from London's deep<BR>
Spumed off, a strange, distorted thing to creep<BR>
From God knows where, and lie, and let all be<BR>
Unheeding, whether of the day or night.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Such tired, hopeless angles of the knees<BR>
And neck and elbows&mdash;and the dawning grey<BR>
Trembling to sunrise; in the park the trees<BR>
Begin to shiver lightly in a breeze,<BR>
And turning watchful kindly eyes away<BR>
The policeman passes slowly on his beat.<BR>

SPRING IN OXFORD STREET<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
A dash of rain on the pavement,<BR>
In the air a gleam of sun,<BR>
And the clouds are white, and rolling high<BR>
From Marble Arch all down the sky<BR>
&mdash;And that's the spring begun!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The sky is all a-shining<BR>
With sunniest blue and white,<BR>
The flags are streaming out full cry<BR>
As the crisp North wind comes bustling by,<BR>
And all the roofs are bright.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And all the shops and houses<BR>
Of sunlit Oxford Street,<BR>
&mdash;Pearl behind amber, gold by rose&mdash;<BR>
To grey the long perspective goes;<BR>
Till all the houses meet.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And there, in every gutter,<BR>
The glory of spring flowers<BR>
The whole long street with colour fills,<BR>
And across the yellow daffodils<BR>
Sharp sunshine and soft showers.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And among the drabs and greys and browns<BR>
Of folk going to and fro<BR>
Are trays of violets, darkly bright,<BR>
And yellow, like the spring moon's light,<BR>
Pale primrose-bunches show.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There's blue in every puddle,<BR>
And every pane of glass<BR>
Has a thousand little dancing suns,<BR>
&mdash;And up and down the glad news runs,<BR>
That spring has come to pass.<BR>

JUDD STREET, ST. PANCRAS<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
My dwelling has a courtyard wide<BR>
Where lord with lady well might pace,<BR>
&mdash;Such silks and velvets side by side,<BR>
And she a fan to shield her face!&mdash;<BR>
It's fine as any king's;<BR>
For there I see on either hand<BR>
The whole great stretch of London lie;<BR>
&mdash;Just so as any king might stand<BR>
Upon his roof, to watch go by<BR>
The flashing pigeon wings.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Just so a king might look abroad:<BR>
"And this is all my own," says he,<BR>
And then he'd turn to some great lord,<BR>
Who'd acquiesce with gravity<BR>
&mdash;But that I do without,<BR>
For all of lord there is up here<BR>
Is this impassive chimney-stack,<BR>
And cloudy be my view or clear<BR>
My courtier will not answer back;<BR>
All silent I look out,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And see the flight of roofs that fade<BR>
Towards the West in golden haze,<BR>
And all this work men's hands have made<BR>
Like jewels in the sun's last rays&mdash;<BR>
I have a dwelling wide;<BR>
Three rooms are mine, but I can go<BR>
Up to this roof in shade or shine,<BR>
And watch all London change and glow<BR>
Rose, purple, gold; three rooms are mine&mdash;<BR>
And all of heaven beside.<BR>

SPARROWS<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Brown little, fat little, cheerful sparrows!<BR>
I like to think, when I hear them chatter,<BR>
How, when the brazen noise was gone<BR>
Of the chariot-wheels, with the sparks a-scatter,<BR>
Their chirp was heard in old Babylon.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In Babylon, and more ancient Memphis,<BR>
They chattered and quarrelled, pecked and fumed,<BR>
And loved their loves, and flew their ways,<BR>
Where the royal Pharaohs lay entombed<BR>
Deep from the daylight's vulgar gaze.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then, just such little homely fellows<BR>
(When the angry monarch, terrible,<BR>
Watched his curled Assyrians writhe)<BR>
They sat, on a carven granite bull<BR>
Unheeding of anguish, feathered and blithe.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So did they sit, on the roofs of Rome,<BR>
And preen themselves in the morning sun;<BR>
And Caesar saw them, brown and grey,<BR>
Whisk in the dust, when his course was run<BR>
And he took to the Forum his fated way.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Oh, changing time; oh, sun and birds<BR>
How little changing.  In the Square<BR>
This winter morning I have met<BR>
Old Egypt's grandson, stopped him there,<BR>
And "Sir, you will outlive me yet,"<BR>
Said I politely, "mark my words."<BR>

THE MOON IN JANUARY<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Sharp and straight are the scaffold poles,<BR>
Black on a delicate sky;<BR>
Upright they stand, across they lie,<BR>
In changeless angles fixed and bound,<BR>
The sunset light in mist is drowned,<BR>
And the moon has risen high;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
High above houses, high and clear<BR>
Above the scaffolding,<BR>
So exquisite, so faint a thing,<BR>
The young moon's silver curve that shines<BR>
Above the fretting, tangled lines,<BR>
With the old moon in her ring.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The young moon holds the old black moon<BR>
In a sky all grey with frost,<BR>
By cable wires barred and crossed,<BR>
And below, the haze of purplish-brown<BR>
Smokes upward from the lamp-lit town<BR>
Where outlines all are lost.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The pure pale arch of windless sky,<BR>
The pure bright young moon's thread,<BR>
These wide and still are overhead;<BR>
And in the dusky glare below<BR>
The lamps go dotting, row on row,<BR>
And there is movement, to and fro,<BR>
Where far the pavements spread.<BR>

AN AUGUST NIGHT, 1914<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The light has gone from the West; the wind has gone<BR>
From the quiet trees in the Park;<BR>
From the houses the open windows yellowly shine,<BR>
The streets are softly dark;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Row upon row the twisted chimneys stand,<BR>
Each angle sharply lined,<BR>
And the mass of the Institute rises, tower and dome,<BR>
Black on the sky behind;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Green is the sky, like some strange precious stone,<BR>
Dark, it yet holds the light<BR>
In its depths, like a bright thing shrouded over or veiled<BR>
By the creeping shadow of night;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And whiter than any whiteness there is upon earth<BR>
A faint star throbs and beats&mdash;<BR>
And the hurrying voices cry the news of the war,<BR>
Below, in the quiet street.<BR>

COUNTED OUT&mdash;OLYMPIA<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The small white space roped off; the hard blue light<BR>
Burning intensely on the narrow ring,<BR>
And every muscle's movement sculpturing<BR>
Harshly, of those two naked men who fight;<BR>
Beyond, the yellow lights that seem to swing<BR>
Across abysmal darkness; and below,<BR>
Tier upon tier, all silent, row on row<BR>
The dense black-coated throng, and all a-strain<BR>
White faces, turned towards the narrow stage,<BR>
Watching intently; watching, nerves and brain,<BR>
As those two men, cut off in that blue glare<BR>
From all reality of place and age<BR>
Wherein our common being has a share,<BR>
Together isolated, watch and creep<BR>
&mdash;Sunk head, hunched shoulders, light of foot and swift,<BR>
Deadly of purpose&mdash;in that ancient game,<BR>
Which was not otherwise in forests deep<BR>
Of earth primeval: that light tread the same,<BR>
The same those watchful eyes, and those quick springs<BR>
Of a snake uncoiling; underneath the skin,<BR>
Glistening with sweat in that unearthly blaze,<BR>
The muscles run and check, like living things.<BR>
And then, the hot air tremulous with the din,<BR>
And all the great crowd surging to its feet,<BR>
Yet like a wave arrested, while the hands<BR>
Of the referee allot the moments' beat;<BR>
The seconds, strung like greyhounds on a leash<BR>
Await the signal; and there's one who stands<BR>
Still guarding, watchful, tense, while all around<BR>
Lamp-light and darkness seem to rock and spin<BR>
In one wild clamour; and upon the ground,<BR>
Beneath the stark blue light, the beaten man!<BR>

  THE GERMAN BAND
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
When I was a little child<BR>
And lived very near the sky,<BR>
A German band was wonderful music<BR>
That could almost make me cry.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It was to me of a beauty<BR>
That I could not understand,<BR>
Though I dimly guessed at sorrow and joy<BR>
In a grown-up distant land.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
All that I know with the years,<BR>
Much that I never shall know,<BR>
Was in my heart when the music came<BR>
In such guise, years ago.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And now when on Friday mornings<BR>
I hear my own child run,<BR>
When the German band in the street starts playing,<BR>
The wonder is never done;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The wonder at ways that our spirit<BR>
May take for itself to rise,<BR>
How a puddle may be a silver lake,<BR>
And a chimney touch the skies.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
All the forms through which spirit<BR>
Yearns and strives to be known<BR>
Are only a little greater or less,<BR>
For great is the Spirit alone.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
There comes an old man to our street,<BR>
Dragging his knobby, lame old feet,<BR>
Once a week he comes and stands,<BR>
A concertina in his hands,<BR>
There in the gutter stops and plays,<BR>
No matter fine or rainy days<BR>
&mdash;Very humble and very old&mdash;<BR>
Pavement's for them who make so bold!<BR>
Prim, starched nurses, and ladies fair<BR>
With taffeta dresses and shining hair,<BR>
And gay little children, who break and run<BR>
To give him a penny&mdash;he seems to feel<BR>
(Out-at-elbows and out-at-heel)<BR>
That they've a right to the morning sun;<BR>
And so with gnarled old hands he'll play<BR>
For an hour, perhaps, then take his way,<BR>
Dragging his knobby, lame old feet<BR>
In the gutter of this quiet street.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is no grudging in his eyes,<BR>
Nor anger, nor the least surprise<BR>
At the uneven scales of fate:<BR>
Glad of the sun, against the rain<BR>
Hunching his shoulders, age and pain<BR>
He takes as his appointed state,<BR>
And stands, like Lazarus, at the door<BR>
With the dread humility of the poor.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I've heard a mad old fiddler play<BR>
Harsh, discordant, broken strains,<BR>
Down the wet street on a winter's day<BR>
When the rain was speckling the window-panes,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And though it was middle afternoon<BR>
And none of the lamps were lighted yet,<BR>
The night had settled down too soon<BR>
And the sky was low and dark and wet.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In a cracked old voice I've heard him sing,<BR>
Strangely capering to and fro,<BR>
Sawing his fiddle on one worn string,<BR>
A grotesque and desolate thing of woe,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Wagging his head and stamping his feet<BR>
(Unwitting of the passers-by<BR>
Hurrying through the gloomy street)<BR>
His shoulders hunched and his head awry.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The children would laugh when they saw him pass,<BR>
And "Look," they'd say, "at Crazy Joe!"<BR>
And press their faces against the glass<BR>
To watch him&mdash;leering and lurching&mdash;go.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Where he comes from, nobody knows,<BR>
But he, being mad, is in God's hand,<BR>
And sacred upon his way he goes;<BR>
And his music&mdash;God will understand.<BR>

Above, the quiet stars and the night wind;<BR>
Below, the lamp-lit streets, and up and down<BR>
The tired, stealthy steps of those who walk<BR>
When the just sleep, at night, in London town.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Poor garish ghosts that haunt the yellow glare,<BR>
Wan spectres, lurking in the alleys dark<BR>
Among the tainted night-smells, while the wind<BR>
Is whispering to the trees across the Park;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For it is summer, may be, and the scent<BR>
Of new-mown hay is sweet across the fields,<BR>
But neither summer, nor the gleaming spring<BR>
One breath of healing to this dark life yields;<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
No morning sunshine greets these sidelong eyes<BR>
With blessings, daughters as they are of gloom,<BR>
Ghosts only, such as seem to have a shape<BR>
At night in some old evil, haunted room.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Would that they were indeed to be dissolved<BR>
At every sunrise!&mdash;they are living souls<BR>
Dragging mortality about foul streets<BR>
While overhead the star-lit heaven rolls.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Living souls are they, and they have their share<BR>
In seed and harvest, and the round world's boon<BR>
Of changing seasons, and the miracle<BR>
Of each month's waxing and waning of the moon.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Living souls are they, prisoned in a net<BR>
Of stealthy streets&mdash;age after age they've gone<BR>
Bearing the burden of a city's sin,<BR>
In London, and old Rome, and Babylon.<BR>

IN THE TUBE<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
A tired, working woman, draggle-tailed,<BR>
Came in, harsh-featured in the yellow glare<BR>
Of electricity; an urchin trailed<BR>
Clumsily after her, with towsled hair,<BR>
And sharp, pale features, and a vacant stare,<BR>
And in her arms she bore another child.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A sick child, doubtless, where all three looked sick;<BR>
The poor legs hanging limply, lean and blue,<BR>
Dangled grotesquely, for the boots, too thick<BR>
For such frail bones a touch could snap in two,<BR>
Like clock-weights seemed to swing, as staggered through<BR>
The burdened mother, till she found a seat.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through dark unnatural to unnatural blaze<BR>
Of stations rocked the train; it tore the air<BR>
To shreds and tatters in the tunnelled ways<BR>
With such a noise as when hell's trumpets blare;<BR>
We, swaying, faced our fellow-creatures there<BR>
Each mercilessly pilloried in light.<BR>
</P>

The sick child lay against the woman's breast<BR>
Asleep, and she looked down on it and smiled,<BR>
And with her gaunt arms made her bird a nest<BR>
Against her poor worn bosom&mdash;sad and mild<BR>
In such wise looked Madonna at her Child<BR>
Where old saints worshipped, round the altar set.<BR>

Grew holy with the Mother and the Child.<BR>

THE SAINT'S BIRTHDAY<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
One of God's blessed pitying saints one day,<BR>
Reaching out hands to touch the azure throne:<BR>
"Because it is my birthday, Lord," he said,<BR>

"Because it is the custom, Lord, of men<BR>
To keep their birthdays gladly, and with gifts<BR>

And from the cloudy rose and amber drifts<BR>
About the Throne, God answered: "It is yours."<BR>

Then sprang the glad Saint earthwards; at his feet<BR>
Were little golden flames, and all his hair<BR>

And like a star he burned through the dark air,<BR>
And came, and stood by farm and shed and byre<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Before the earliest grey was in the East,<BR>
Or the first smoke above the chimney-stack<BR>

And bird and beast, and all that lived and grew:<BR>

He stood there, in the village of his life<BR>
Ere he won heaven, and the breath of cows<BR>
Came as a benediction, and the smell<BR>

Long grass, and running water in the dell.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And his heart opened with the love he had<BR>
For the dear toil-worn dwelling-place of men;<BR>
To hear the sheep crop, see the glimmering grey<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Not otherwise was Eden once&mdash;he thought&mdash;<BR>
And by God's blessing it may be anew:<BR>

Time ceased to be; and yet the sun and shade<BR>

Unwitheringly lovely filled the fields.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And all day long the birds in ecstasy<BR>
Sang without shadow of hawk or thought of death,<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
When all was done he stepped back, childish-wise,<BR>
To see and love his handiwork, and then<BR>

But the heart of men his love could not renew:<BR>

With its sad weight of personality.<BR>
Then God leaned down to his poor saint, and said:<BR>

The hedge-side thistles that flower, the small brown lark that sings,<BR>

The snails are out in the sunshine after the morning rain,<BR>
And the wasps are whirring and buzzing round the mulberry tree again,<BR>

O love that dwells in the innermost heart of man<BR>
Secret and dark and still,<BR>

Height upon height and depth upon depth where never the eye can see<BR>
The brown bird, hidden and still.<BR>

O Love that is wild and eager, sun-lit and free<BR>
Like a seagull that turns in the sunlight above the sea;<BR>
Between the sea and the sky it flashes and turns,<BR>
And the sun on its wings is white,<BR>
While sharply and shrill by the headland the keen wind sings<BR>
Where the grass is salt and grey<BR>
With the beating winter spray,<BR>
And the seagull sweeps and soars on magnificent wings.<BR>

That cannot live in the light,<BR>

When over the evening river the wild swan flies<BR>
The curve of those wings is like the arch of the skies<BR>
Over the shielded earth.<BR>
Love is most like a bird,<BR>
For birds have least of the dust that gave them birth,<BR>
They soar and poise and float,<BR>
They wheel and swerve and skim,<BR>
And their wings are strong to the wind, and swift to the light,<BR>
And their voice is a promise of dawn while yet it is night,<BR>
And their song is a pæan of hope before it is spring,<BR>
And the song of the bird to his mate is lyrical love.<BR>

Life, in its unimaginable heights,<BR>
When we may seize and apprehend the true<BR>
Soul essence, of one nature with the stars:<BR>
Rare moments when our senses are a mist<BR>
That the truth shines through:&mdash;oh, most strange and rare,<BR>
Such ecstasies as unimprisoned souls<BR>
Experience in that thin empyrean<BR>
Beyond the gross world; this we two have known<BR>
We two together.  There are memories<BR>
Of such high happiness in a fence of pain<BR>
As martyrs in their fiery heart of death<BR>
Have blessed their God for; passion and holiness,<BR>
When all the body (sinew, bone, and brain)<BR>
Are like a harp, from which the spirit makes<BR>
Marvels of harmony; some sense too rare<BR>
To be called happiness, not to be named indeed<BR>
In human speech&mdash;this we have touched and known<BR>
Together, at some thrilling edge of time.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I fall away from it; the barriers close<BR>
About me; I descend from the clear heights<BR>
Into the plains and valleys of the world.<BR>
The traffic of the market-place is mine,<BR>
The heat and dust, the jostling and the noise,<BR>
The kindly challenge and the neighbour-talk,<BR>
All these may claim me, so that I forget<BR>
To lift my eyes and see the far-off peaks,<BR>
And the eternal splendour of the stars.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So be it; let the tide of men's affairs<BR>
Carry me back and forward; let the rub<BR>
Of greasy ha'pence passed from hand to hand,<BR>
In humble traffic of a bunch of herbs<BR>
Not pass me by; let me jog arm in arm,<BR>
Or cheek by jowl, the shady side o' the street,<BR>
With friends and neighbours, glad to know them there,<BR>
Imperfect, human, kind, and tolerant.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So may the years go.  Yet, when the call comes,<BR>
And the world's colours fade before the eye<BR>
That turns for spiritual vision on itself;<BR>
When, from the four walls of the silent room,<BR>
The noises of the world fall back and fail<BR>
In that great silence which enrings the last<BR>
Ecstatic moment of experience,<BR>
Here on this earth&mdash;ah, then indeed I know<BR>
That I shall find you.  All that lies behind<BR>
(The years of trivial experience)<BR>
Shall open and fall back from off my soul,<BR>
As falls the brown sheaf from the opening bud;<BR>
And in that poignant moment, that mere breath<BR>
Of temporal time, that aeon of the soul,<BR>
I shall reach out and know you, mix with you<BR>
As flame with flame, as ray with ray of light,<BR>
Be perfectly yourself, as you are me,<BR>
With all else fallen, gone, dispersed away<BR>
Save the pure drop of spiritual essence&mdash;Then<BR>
Let come what may, light or oblivion.<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
